first attempt to make a calculator work.

as per usee, here is what i think i want to code.
1. html include all the button and display. the button can be 'classed' as numbers, operand, and others, like decimals, and clear all, and back-space.
2. css to make sure it was stylish/presentable at the begining, also including classes that could help like if the button pressed, or if the button hovered, etc.
3. javascript, which is the main menu here.
    include ability to math,
    ability to input digits by digits,
    ability to error handling, eg if input zeroes, or if input divisible by zeros, etc

challenges that i could think of as of now.
1. ability to click digit by digit
2. decimals point
3. ability to limit the output digits
